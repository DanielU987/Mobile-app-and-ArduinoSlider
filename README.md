# Arduino Bluetooth Control App for Android

## Introduction
This is an Android application that allows you to connect to an Arduino board equipped with a Bluetooth module and send commands to control its movement. The app provides a user-friendly interface to send commands for moving the Arduino robot forward or backward.

## Features
- Connect to an Arduino board via Bluetooth.
- Send commands to move the Arduino robot forward or backward.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Prerequisites
To use this app, you need the following:
- An Android device running Android OS 4.4 (KitKat) or higher.
- An Arduino board equipped with a Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05 or HC-06).
- A compatible motor driver connected to the Arduino board to control the robot's movement.
- The Arduino code for receiving commands and controlling the motors.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with the Arduino Bluetooth Control app:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub or download and extract the ZIP file.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Connect your Android device to your computer via USB and enable USB debugging mode in the Developer options.
4. Build and run the app on your Android device.
5. Make sure your Arduino board is properly connected to the motor driver and the Bluetooth module.
6. Power up the Arduino board and ensure that the Bluetooth module is discoverable.
7. On the Android app, tap the "Connect" button to scan and connect to the available Bluetooth devices.
8. Once connected, you can use the "Forward" and "Backward" buttons to send commands for robot movement.

## Customization
You can customize the app to fit your specific requirements. Here are some possible enhancements:
- Add additional commands for controlling different movements (e.g., turning left or right).
- Implement speed control for the robot's movement.
- Enhance the user interface with additional features or visual indicators.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using the app, consider the following troubleshooting steps:
- Ensure that the Bluetooth module is properly connected and discoverable.
- Check the wiring connections between the Arduino board, motor driver, and Bluetooth module.
- Verify that the Arduino code for receiving commands is correctly uploaded to the board.
- Make sure that the app has the necessary permissions to access Bluetooth on your device.
